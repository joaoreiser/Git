Python code to generate TFRecord file with TensorFlow

The code sample is used for a two classes dataset (Heal and Sick). The
folders path with the pictures and generated file path+name must be informed. 
In this case, both the pictures folders must have the same amount of samples.

Feel free to clone and adapt this code for your need.
